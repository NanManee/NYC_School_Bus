# NYC-Bus-Breakdown-and-Delays
The system for tracking bus breakdowns and delays gathers data from school bus vendors actively operating in the field in real-time. When bus personnel encounter delays during their routes, they're directed to communicate with the dispatcher at the central office of the bus vendor. Subsequently, the bus vendor's staff is prompted to access the Bus Breakdown and Delay system to document the incident and inform OPT. Customer service representatives at OPT utilize this system to update parents calling about bus service inquiries. The Bus Breakdown and Delay system is openly accessible and provides real-time updates, with all information inputted by school bus vendor staff.
